              <strong>Opening  Session:</strong><br><br>
Chaired by Professor Ahmad Ismail Mustafa, the  session was addressed by CARES Chairman Dr. A. Majeed Khan, Professor Md.  Rafiqul Hoque, Vice Chancellor of BAU, Dr. Mohammad Rafiqul Islam, Secretary  M/O Science and Technology and chief guest Architect Yeafesh Osman, Hon&rsquo;ble Minister  of Science and Technology. Dr. Atiur Rahman, who was scheduled to attend this  session, joined the concluding session instead.<br><br>
Welcoming the guests and participants, Professor  Mustafa referred to the importance of R&amp;D and its commercialization, stating  that the country needs a technology platform and such a platform could be  provided by the BCSIR. He further stated that CARES and BCSIR had joined hands  and was addressing all stakeholders to advance science for the benefit of the  country. He stated that the government was committed to promotion of science  and had drawn up a National Science Policy 2011. It is creating the necessary  environment in the BCSIR. One state-of-art Laboratory had been set up (DRICM)  in 2012 and another coming up in Sylhet soon. Drawing attention to the scientists  of the BCSIR, he said that by extending the retirement age to 67 for BCSIR  scientists, it is now time to work and contribute more to the nation. The  government is committed, the Hon&rsquo;ble Minister is supportive, now it is time to  bring qualitative change in the organization, BCSIR Chairman added. All have to  give their best and impact factor has to be assessed. Referring to the CSIR,  India&rsquo;s work in both low-tech and high-tech fields which have been able to  provide technology platform for India   and have been helping the path of development and knowledge, he stated  that Bangladesh would like to learn from the experiences of other countries,  and in particular from neighbors. The BCSIR Chairman stated that Professor  Brahmachari&rsquo;s presence had laid the ground for building bridge between his  organization and the BCSIR for future substantive work for mutual benefit.<br><br>
CARES Chairman Dr. A. Majeed Khan began by saying  that he believed in friendship. He recounted to BCSIR&rsquo;s founding in 1955  through the efforts of Dr. Qudrat-i-Khuda, its subsequent growth, its rich  human and facility resources. He then mentioned the Bangladesh Agricultural University,  terming it as the largest science and learning institute in Bangladesh. He  added that utilizing the two institutions optimally, a technology platform for Bangladesh  could be developed. Dr. Khan stated that CARES believes in ethos:  science-industry-commerce linkage. He then gave a brief account of the genesis  of CARES, its vision and catalyst work undertaken. He stated that &ldquo;we can play  in the game in the fields of science and technology-research, extension and  services- promoting targeted research to improve quality of life&rdquo;. He thanked  the BCSIR and the Hon&rsquo;ble State Minister for joining his efforts for marriage  between science and commerce with a view to &ldquo;reach out to every single person&rdquo;.  He quoted from Dr. Brahmachri&rsquo;s conversation with him the previous evening when  the latter had mentioned that the strength of a country today is not measured  by the number or type of weapons it had, but by knowledge base. He concluded by  pointing to the BCSIR scientists that &ldquo;you are on a pledge to build a  technology platform for Bangladesh from here&rdquo;.<br><br>
The Vice Chancellor of BAU Professor Mr. Rafiqul  Hoque stated that there is no alternative to research. He also stated that follow-up  of research do not happen in many instances. He stated that dedicated research  is needed for climate change adaptations and for feeding our160 million  population. He added that BAU have more than 200 research programs and more  than 1000 research projects on going. What is needed now is how to get these  adopted, extended and accepted. &ldquo;Action for research and research for action  are the needs of the time&rdquo;. He commented that international collaboration for research  is valuable.  On behalf of BAU, he  pledged to work with relevant institutions to build a united platform for  science and research, much needed to face the growing challenges of the time.<br><br>
Science and Technology Secretary  Spoke about the expectations of general  population from the BCSIR, stating that they could be questioning about what impact,  if any, had come out of the BCSIR. He questioned that if he himself had not seen  any impact so far, how could average Bangladeshis assess any impact? He complimented  CARES for arranging the seminar, commenting that this was needed much earlier.  He stated that the government was pro-science, being very much committed to  fulfill the goals of &ldquo;Vision 2021&rdquo; by using science and technology,  and had been investing in these areas. He  stated that while impact of research in agriculture was visible, research in  other areas were not. He invited private sector to invest in research and also  to use the laboratory facilities in BCSIR, BAEC and the NIB so that all are  benefitted from these institutions. <br>
Chief Guest of the Seminar Architect Yeafesh Osman  began by paying rich complements to Dr. A. Majeed Khan for being so diligently  pursuing and making this event come to happen. In his address he extensively  used quotes from his poems and stressed that technology has to reach villages  and enrich the lives of village people, otherwise it would not have much impact  for the country. He stated that the government was doing whatever possible to  take technology to villages, stating that some youths in villages are now using  laptops as well. He however admitted that more investment was required for  higher scientific education and research. He added Bangladesh is progressing  and that science could bring change in the country and take the country forward  to attain middle income country status. He asked the scientists to concentrate on  research taking into account the need of the people. He mentioned that by  advancing the retiring age of BCSIR scientists to 67 years, a historic decision  had been taken. He hoped that this will generate more impact for the nation. He  stated that science is for life, if knowledge stops, then it amounts to death.<br><br>
<strong>Second  Session: The keynote address</strong><br><br>
The session was chaired by Science and Technology  Secretary. The Hon&rsquo;ble State Minister was among those who attended the keynote address  by Professor S.K. Brahmachari. (A power point presentation was made with video  clips)<br>
Dr. Brahmachari thanked Dr. A. Majeed Khan for  inviting him to visit Dhaka and to address the Seminar, adding that &ldquo;he had  come not as the DG of CSIR or as Secretary of the Government of India, but as a  Bengali scientist&rdquo; whose family happens to be from this city of Dhaka. He  introduces himself as a homegrown scientist, all his studies and work done  within India. He introduced CSIR as being the highest scientific body and &ldquo;a  highly guarded secret of India&rdquo;. He termed the CSIR as a vast network of  organization with 39 institutes, 38 labs, 6 units, but it has such a technology  connected system that DG could hold video conference with all the centers and access  all institutions from his office. He then gave a brief historic account of  research institutes in India, beginning in 1909 with the Tata Institute, the  Bose Institute (1920), CSIR beginning as an autonomous society (1942), and the  1950-2000 period being the growth of CSIR system of Laboratories scattered all  over India. He added that the most growth had taken place since 2000. The CSIR  motto is &ldquo;Creating experts and leaders&rdquo;. Between 1970 and 1990, India had to  face technology denial from the Western countries due to its nuclear armaments  program and, as a result, acquiring new technology suffered.<br><br>
Dr. Brahmachari also gave a historical outline of  the growth of science in India, starting from the 1930s during the colonial  period when three centers of excellence had existed, one being in Dhaka  University. He mentioned that that was the time when some Indian scientists  left India to make career. He mentioned that he was influenced by Dr. G.N.  Ramachandram and others to seek higher studies and a scientific career within  India. He also stated that looking at the BCSIR brochure, the CSIR in the early  years had similar objectives. He stated that the science got a boost in India  through the vision of the founding Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru when he  proclaimed that &ldquo;It is science alone that can solve the problems of hunger and  poverty…..&rdquo;.  It was Nehru and Bhatnagar  efforts that had laid the foundation of CSIR. Today, the CSIR have some 4600  scientists working in its 37 Labs, 39 Centers, and 3 institutes with a budget  outlay of Rs. 4500 Crore. The research and development activities of CSIR  includes various fields such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering" title="Aerospace engineering">aerospace engineering</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_engineering" title="Structural engineering">structural engineering</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography" title="Oceanography">ocean sciences</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_sciences" title="Life sciences">life sciences</a>, earth system science, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy" title="Metallurgy">metallurgy</a>,  defense equipment, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical" title="Chemical">chemicals</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining" title="Mining">mining</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_science" title="Food science">food</a> and nutrition, affordable  healthcare,  genomics, biotechnology, bioinformatics, synthetic biology, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather" title="Leather">leather</a>,  farm machinery, agro-technology, agro-chemical, ceramics, glass, traffic  management technology and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_science" title="Environmental science">environment</a>. Among some major  achievements of CSIR are: special indelible ink for use during elections and  Amul baby food (1960), wind tunnel, crop friendly pesticides, Swaraj tractors,  male contraceptive and mark II pump (1970s), super computer, nuclear plant  protection glass (1980s) , Menthol mint, enzyme-processed leather,  petrochemicals, drugs, DNA finger printing (1990s), Sonalika tractor, genome  technology and small aircrafts in the last decade. Indian science had  transformed itself from being national and was already a world leader when Dr.  Brahmachari took over as DG in 2007. <strong>He  added that when he became DG, he started asking questions about the relevance of  CSIR as in this Seminar someone was asking: Are you relevant? The Indian Prime  Minister asked him to build a new CSIR without creating a chaos. Dr.  Brahmachari mentioned that the CSIR had remained relevant to the nation by  constantly reinventing itself to stay ahead. </strong>Under his leadership, CSIR  began to assess the need of the people. While it looked at its glorious past,  it took into account the challenges of the present and promises of the future.  CSIR adopted a new definition of strategy and execution:<br>
1. Excellence in science,<br>
2. Global competitiveness,<br>
3. Local relevance,<br>
4. Innovation,<br>
5. Scientifically challenging goals.<br><br>
Dr. Brahmachari stated that in 2012 CSIR  contribution in the GDP of the country had been 18.1%. He showed that CSIR  research and development are globally competitive, where CSIR does not work,  foreign technology is dominant.  Today  CSIR is the largest public funded R&amp;D organization in India and also the  custodian of technology and patents in India. CSIR has also been showcasing  their products abroad by participating in industrial fairs. <strong>Dr. Brahmachari stated that &ldquo;we took lab  outside CSIR, by spreading across India, having some 140 industrial partners  and stakeholders. </strong>It encourages its scientists to travel abroad with  families and some 1000 of them travel abroad every year.<br><br>
<strong>Dr.  Brahmachari outlined the new CSIR vision: Vision 2022 .  He stated that he had been in charge of an  old ship and expected to turn it into a modern-day nuclear powered aircraft  career-</strong>that is the type of challenge ahead. He does not  believe in single leadership, young scientists and stakeholders are very much  in focus. He put CSIR vision as follows:<br>
Strive for global scientific impact, catalyze  innovation driven industry, and nurture trans-disciplinary leadership and  inclusive economic development.<br><br>
He put <strong>CSIR  mantras as: nation centric, knowledge intensive, innovation driven, in  partnership, globally benchmarked, inclusion focused, value and ethos based</strong> for taking the CSIR to 2022. He made a strict rule for his senior scientists:  never take away a young scientist&rsquo;s work and pass as your own and always to put  young scientists&rsquo; name in any work where they were involved and made  contribution.<br><br>
Dr. Brahmachari mentioned that since 2007 CSIR had  been providing scholarships and comes first in publication numbers within  India, ahead of all IITs. Its scientists have more than 5000 world class  publications and have published in prominent international journals. CSIR is  now seeing a growth rate of 20-25% per year and there is extensive private  sector involvement with CSIR work. In the global benchmark for R&amp;D CSIR  ranks ahead of many prominent US institutes and ranks among top 82 (MIT is  ranked 46). Per dollar value in research output, CSIR is positioned well among  some prominent national scientific and industrial organizations like  CNRS (France), CSIRO (Austria), and CSIR  (South Africa). Max Plank Institute (Germany), CSIR India is positioned well in  terms of quality work and reputation. It holds many US patents and intellectual  property rights and is a good model to emulate for efficiency, Dr. Brahmachari  remarked.<br><br>
On the issue of marriage with industry, CSIR got a  directive from Pundit Nehru and had been pursuing such goal ever since. The  government was pushing scientists to deliver success in disaster mitigation as  well. He stated the CSIR works for &ldquo;socially relevant S&amp;T interventions&rdquo;. The  organization had successfully made science and technology interventions in  private sector industries to develop &lsquo;cold rolled grain oriented electrical  sheet&rsquo; manufacturing, made Moradabad brass product with permanent luster,  mitigation a disease in mango orchards, improving better production method for  mirror-polish tiles to bring down production costs, energy efficient brass  melting furnace as examples of demand driven innovations. <strong>The new CSIR is trying to send out a message to the public: find a  problem, tell scientists and they will help.</strong><br><br>
Dr. Brahmachari also mentioned how CSIR is involved  in developing UAV (AUV-150), unmanned underwater vehicle for seabed research  and the development or aircraft with Mahindra Aerospace, AVP (Automated  Ventricular Profiler) with the understanding <em>that nothing is local, all is global. </em>He added that today the CSIR  is competing globally in petrochemical, material and mineral sectors. It has  developed high tension carbon fiber plants and auto parts and laser weapons research.  It had also built mobile bridge inspection units, earthquake proof building  materials and has been working with Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited. CSIR is  also involved in fuel cell polymers, electrolytes, optical fiber amplifiers,  nanotechnology, and making potash from sea water. CSIR is also involved in high  end agro-research, synthetic biology, cloning seeds and research in GM seeds  that would not make farmers depended on seed companies like Montserrat-farmers  would be able to grow their own. &ldquo;<strong>CSIR  wants to scale new horizons and provide the fourth paradigm of science&rdquo;</strong>-the  DG remarked. It wants to develop data intensive scientific discovery. He also  spoke on how the CSIR research was driving the pharmaceutical sector of India. <br><br>
He spoke on his involvement with the <strong>Open Source Drug Discovery</strong>  (OSDD) concept and how the Indian population  was benefitting from cheaper drug thus manufactured. He gave an example of an  HIV compound drug and how the unit cost came down from USD 10,000 to USD 80  when new drug was discovered and produced in India. So far, the OSDD network  has roped in around 6,000 scientists, 80&nbsp;percent of them Indian, from some  130 countries, including Bangladeshis. Along with the Global&nbsp;Alliance on  TB, it's formed partnerships with around 40 Indian&nbsp;universities and  multinationals like AstraZeneca, Hewlett-Packard,&nbsp;Infosys and Sun  Microsystems. And in addition to the TB treatment it's&nbsp;testing with the  Global Alliance, the network also has two more&nbsp;anti-TB molecules in  advanced stages of research, and has nascent programs in the works for malaria  and Leishmaniasis — a potentially&nbsp;fatal disease transmitted by certain  species of sand fly.<br><br>
<strong>He  suggested that Bangladesh could give tax breaks to industries that are involved  in R&amp;D and see how this would encourage others.</strong><br><br>
Dr. Brahmachari in his presentation mentioned that  when CSIR was working to make healthcare affordable, it had made scientific  interventions in drug design and research and price of essential medicines came  down. He mentioned that CSIR had made cheaper clot-bursting drugs  (streptokinase) and working on other new drug portfolio. A new and indigenously  developed drug to treat TB patients is on trial, he stated. He added that the <strong>CSIR was presently involved in generic and  as well as genomic medicines.</strong> He also stated that his interest is to blend genomics  with ayurvedic what will be known as &ldquo;Ayurgenomics&rdquo;. He stated that Mayo Clinic  in the USA had been working with the CSIR and putting technology together. He  stated that things could be done ethically, and CSIR is showing this way. His  intention was to make health affordable to all through OSDD.<br><br>
<strong>Dr.  Brahmachari said that he, as a Bengali scientist, not representing CSIR, was  willing to assist BCSIR in all possible manner, adding that Bengal has  scientific legacy. Now we have to identify our talents and capabilities.</strong> The DG CSIR about the newly founded Academy of Scientific and Innovative  Research (ACSIR), created in 2011through a Parliamentary Act, aimed to create  highest quality personnel with cross-disciplinary knowledge to provide leaders in  the field of science and technology with an approach not taken by other Indian  institutes of higher learning He stated that the object of the ACSIR is to  produce 1000 Ph.D. and 2000 post doctoral every year.<br><br>
Dr. Brahmachari concluded with the following advice,  borrowing from Noble Laureate Dr. David Baltimore:<br>
1. Demand excellence,<br>
2. Concentrate on resources,<br>
3. Create small environment,<br>
4. Maintain unity of teaching and research,<br>
5. Ensure academic freedom.<br><br>
Guests and participants gave the keynote speaker a  standing ovation for his interesting and lucid presentation.<br>
(Four designated speakers, each from DCCI, MIDAS,  BSCIC and SME Foundation spoke and made some comments).<br><br>
<strong>The  concluding session:</strong><br><br>
Chaired by Dr. M. Zainul Abedin from CARES,  the session had a presentation from the BCSIR on &ldquo;Research achievements of  BCSIR ready for commercialization.&rdquo; Dr. Samina Ahmed made the power point presentation  providing an account of the organization&rsquo;s journey as a provincial research  laboratory  in 1955 to the present. She  mentioned that there were 9 research units, the newest state-of-art DRICM was inaugurated  in 2012 and another one is coming up soon in Sylhet. She mentioned that there  has been transition from basic research to applied research.

Dr. Atiur Rahman, Governor of Bangladesh Bank joined  the session at this stage and was introduced to Dr. Brahmachari. Dr. Abedin  informed Dr. Rahman that the highlight points of DG, CSIR&rsquo;s presentation was  that they had achieved success due to: critical human resources, right policy  direction and funding. Economic impact and employment generation had come as a  result. Dr. Abedin then invited Professor Brahmachari to make some comments  before giving floor to the Governor. Dr. Brahmachari stated that the role of  banks is important. In India 2% of  banks&rsquo; profit is allocated to CSR work by law.  He stated that CSIR does not take any money from the banking sector, but has  created a company named CSR Tech Private Limited with private sector equity  participation to commercialize R&amp;D, 10% retained by CSIR. It has now a  capital of 100 Crore Rupees.  He had arranged  with the Governor of State Bank to invest in this company which was announced  recently in the presence of the Prime Minister. He requested Bangladesh Bank Governor  to allocate special fund for utilization to commercialize patented technology  and update technology, adding that such a fund could be used by entrepreneurs  who have to commit using local patent and generate employment. He also stated  that job creation and thriving for economic impact with home grown technology  require fund and researchers also need fund. He suggested that to stop brain  drain, technology needs to be developed and that CSIR would be willing to work  with BCSIR to help develop suitable technology base. Dr. Brahmachari thanked CARES  for &ldquo;building bridge&rdquo; between CSIR and BCSIR.<br><br>
Governor of Bangladesh Bank Dr. Atiur Rahman paid tribute  to CARES Chairman Dr. Majeed Khan and expressed his happiness for being  associated with his concept. He added that he had rescheduled his departure for  Washington by a day to attend this event at the request of Dr. Khan. He stated  that the country was changing, we may not notice, and hoped that Bangladesh  would soon be a role model for the developing world. He added that Bangladesh  offers unlimited opportunities and was growing steadily over the past decade  with over 6% annual growth. Inflation was in control, around 7% currently,  social indicators are better than India&rsquo;s; there was no reason to be  disappointed. Time has come to give push for technology as scientists as  critical mass exists. Lacking is in public investment, adding that though there  has been investment in education, it is not spreading enough in higher  education and sciences. <strong>He acknowledged  that there has been brain drain as we did not invest in research. He stated  that both the government and private sector have to focus more on this aspect.</strong> <strong>He further stated that our growing  economy needs inputs form science and technology, stating that  technology-driven economy is crucial.  </strong> He added that we are in a globalized world  where knowledge and public good are important. But we have not been able to yet  make science culture easy and reachable because of lack of policy attention and  support, he stated. He said that academics had to be entrepreneurs like many  other countries where a number of them were involved in teaching, research and  business about the same time.<br><br>
He spoke on seed money and where this could come  from, suggesting that it could come from the financial sector and their CSR  fund. He stated that CSR fund, unlike in India, is not mandatory in Bangladesh.  But the Bangladesh Bank has a policy of encouraging banks to undertake social  responsibilities. <strong>As the custodian of  the banking sector and a researcher himself, Dr. Atiur Rahman stated that he  has been urging the bankers to be more responsible to the society. The BB has a  policy to monitor CSR activities of all banks, which are required to report on  this aspect. As a result, while four years ago banks had spent Tk. 50 crore, in  2012 the amount had increased to 305 crores. </strong>In addition, the BB now has  established its own CSR fund with Tk. 5 crore from itself and Tk. 2 crore  contributed from commercial banks. The BB was considering spending the money in  disaster management and mitigation preparations.<br><br>
<strong>He  then turned to CARES and its work. He stated that CARES is in the right path for  promotion of science and knowledge.  If  it remains committed to its goal, its funding should not be a problem, he  stated. He also suggested that CARES prepares suitable business plan for taking  research forward.</strong><br><br>
He mentioned about DCCI President&rsquo;s discussion with  the Chairman of BCSIR regarding using of processes for new entrepreneurs. He  further stated that for incubation of new enterprises, SME fund, Agro-process  Industry Fund could be used as Bangladesh Bank had already allocated Tk. 100  crore . He requested BCSIR to see that their processes are commercialized by  some of the 2000 entrepreneurs that DCCI is now committed to create<strong>. </strong>The Governor stated that he believed  in science and its ability to help growth and productivity. He stated that  technology had to be acceptable to the people, adding that organizations like BRRI,  BARI and BAU had produced &ldquo;public good&rdquo;. He also stated that for setting up big  agro-processing industries, agro-processing fund is there. Dr. Rahman also stated  that new laboratories have to be created with donations from corporate bodies  as banks cannot set up labs. He emphasized that Bangladesh needs technology at  each and all homes. He quoted Tagore and stated that he saw the need to bring technology  products and benefit to rural areas. The Governor also stressed on the need for  public-private partnership for science, adding that this could be the bridge to  attain public good, commenting them alone, one man is just a fragment! He also  stated that women should come forward to be entrepreneurs. He referred to Tk.  3400 crore rural credit disbursed from Bangladesh bank fund and Tk. 500 crore  for marginal farmers disburse through BRAC. Dr. Atiur Rahman concluding with a  suggestion that our scientists need not only be confined to laboratories, but  also be involved in socialization!<br><br>
The session concluded with a vote of thanks by Dr. A.I.  Mustafa, Chairman of BCSIR. He stated that the day (October 8) was a memorable  day for BCSIR and its scientists for the following reasons: (1) they had  listened to a presentation from head of a similar organization from the  subcontinent about its achievements and felt inspired, (2) a bridge has now  been built through CARES for future BCSIR-CSIR collaboration, and (3) on the  day the Parliament was extending the retirement age of BCSIR scientists to 67  so that they could contribute more to the nation!</p>
