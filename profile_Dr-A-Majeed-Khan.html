             <p>Dr.  A. Majeed Khan, born at Faridpur in 1929 educated in Kolkata (India), London  and Minnesota, USA has the distinction of being the first Ph.D. in  Sociology &amp; Anthropology (1958), in Bangladesh.<br> <br>
While  finishing his doctorate in rural sociology and applied anthropology, at the  University of Minnesota, USA in 1958, Khan was selected as <i>one</i> <i>of nine</i> young  scholars - all in social sciences with some statistical background â€“ together  with legendary Akhter Hameed Khan, to plan and execute a rural development  strategy principally drawing upon American rural development experience, by  establishing the Academy for Rural Development, in Comilla, Bangladesh. Khan  worked at this Academy till mid-1964. In this period, through field research  and demonstration/action projects he developed different strategies of integrated  family planning program together with comprehensive rural development  incorporating women&rsquo;s participation in home economics, family health welfare. Most  of those programs and efforts were later incorporated into two successive  5-Years&rsquo; national socio-economic development Plans of 1965 and 1970s  (pre-Independence). Â <br>
In  the summer of 1964, Khan was invited to deliver the keynote address on  Agricultural development in Asia at the International Conference of Rural  Sociology held in Dijon, France. In the remaining year he served as a part-time  teacher at the Institute of Education of the University of Stockholm and  simultaneously, as a consultant to Swedish International Development Agency (then  known as NIB; later renamed as SIDA). <br> <br>
Khan&rsquo;s first experiment  with higher education dates back to 1964  when he established the School of Social Work at Rajshahi University, with an innovative curriculum which provided for  hands-on-experience to classroom teaching, In the same years he was appointed  an Adviser to Pakistan National Planning Commission on health, education and  social development; when simultaneously he held executive positions in several  national voluntary social and professional organizations (<i>eg</i>: Vice President, Pakistan Public Health Association, Pakistan National  Council of Social Welfare, National Commission for UNESCO).<br> <br>
In  1968, Khan was appointed by the United Nations, as (again) <i>one of nine</i> &lsquo;inter-regional&rsquo; officers -<i>other eight recruited as one from Eastern Europe and two from Latin America  and one each from United Kingdom, USA, Canada, Egypt, India; and Khan from  Pakistan</i> - to provide policy and program support to member-governments to  focus on human resources development to optimize socio-economic growth of  respective countries. <br><br>
Following  a six weeks brain-storming at UN Headquarters in New York and two weeks  briefing at UN agencies&rsquo; in Paris (UNESCO), Geneva (ILO &amp; WHO) and Rome  (FAO), Khan was posted to Indonesia (<i>in  the reconstruction phase after the fall of legendary President Soekarno</i>)  with concurrent responsibility for Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. At the end  of two years in that assignment, in 1971 Khan&rsquo;s job responsibility was extended  to cover all United Nations member countries in south-east Asia, particularly  adding Thailand Korea and the Philippines to the previous charge with the  relocated posting at ECAFE. in Bangkok, <br><br>
After  a period of 18 months in that post, in mid-1972 Khan was transferred to New  York as a Senior Program Officer to help structure the newly formed <b>United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA</b>)  under the leadership of Rafael Salas (<i>a Pilipino  and a former Executive Secretary (i.e. the Prime Minister)</i> <i>of the Country</i>). After one year in that  post, Khan was transferred to Sri Lanka as the first Regional Coordinator of UNFPA  to help develop and execute an inter-agencies&rsquo; six million dollars 5-years&rsquo;  Population Development Program in Sri Lanka. After 4 years on the post, Khan  was transferred to the region of West Asia, again as the Regional Coordinator  of UNFPA as the first time input from the United Nations system, to develop  policy and programs on integrated population and development. For working in this  vast region, Khan chose his own duty station Amman, the capital of Jordan in  deference to Beirut (UN agencies regional headquarters) or Damascus, the  largest metropolitan city in the region. From Amman, he served the Gulf States,  Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Oman, and two Yemens â€“ north and south on planning for health  policy, education and social development. Â <br><br>
While  still serving with the <b>United Nations  Development Program (UNDP)</b> and agencies in the personal rank of a senior  Director (D.2) he was recalled home in March 1982 to join the Government as the  Minister of Education, and concurrently the Minister of Culture &amp; Sports,  Science and Technology, and the Minister of Religious Affair; and on a second  stint, Minister of Planning (1984-85). From 1985 to 1987 he was Bangladesh  Ambassador to France Spain and Morocco and Ambassador cum Permanent  Representative of Bangladesh to the UNESCO. <br>
In 1988 he  took up teaching again as Visiting Professor in the Centre of Strategic Studies  at the University of Jordan, Amman. Later, in 1989, he was Guest Professor at  the International Institute of Education, the University of Stockholm, Sweden.  While still with the UN, Khan served a summer (1977) as a visiting professor at  the University of Leiden, Holland. Â Â <br>
In the period  with the United Nations, the government; and privately, Khan has chaired and  participated in many international conferences and seminars. Among others, he served  as an elected member of Executive Committee of the UNESCO (1983-87), attended  the Ministerial meeting of the Non-Aligned Committee on Palestine in 1983, (held  in Delhi); Vice Chairman, Fourth Extraordinary Session of the General  Conference of the UNESCO, held in Paris in November-December 1984, Chairman of  the First Committee of the 24th General Conference of UNESCO (1987);  Chairman of the Regional Program Review Committee of the South Asia Region, International  Planned Parenthood federation (IPPF), Â 1989-1995; a member of  the Advisory Board of <b>Asia Fellows  Program </b>(jointly sponsored by the Institute of International Education  (IIE/USA) and Ford Foundation  (1999-2002). <br><br>
Post-retirement  and drawing upon his experience of higher education needs and quality <i>cum</i> accreditation experience through the  UNESCO; and experience as the Minister of Education at home, Khan, in  consultation with a number of eminent educationists in the country, in the  States and the United Kingdom; and in responding to an appeal from a pioneering  generation of young industrialists â€“ mostly parents of school-finishing  teen-aged children - and a scion of a noble family friend with an offer of 21  acres of land for a proposed university, Â drafted a scheme of establishing a private  university on the basis of the bludgeoning economic need and social aspirations  of the emerging youth of the country. It was called the I<b>ndependent University Banglades</b>h (<b>IUB)</b> â€“ founded in 1991 and registered in 1993). It was modeled after  American higher education to reflect two critical qualities: (a) to root in its  community and (b) engage in search for knowledge. National Professor M. Innas  Ali, a renowned Physicist was appointed as the first Rector (honorary) of IUB.  While at IUB, Khan spent a semester (1997) as a Senior Fulbright Fellow at  Hamline University, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA <br><br>
Spending  7 years as the President of IUB after producing 3 batches of 4-years graduates  in subjects like <i>business administration,  communication and environmental management,</i> Khan retired from IUB and went  to University of Wisconsin, Madison as a Resident Fellow in the Department of Rural  Sociology in the College of Agriculture. While at Wisconsin he organized a  special session on the issues of <i>emerging  &lsquo;globalization&rsquo;</i> at the Annual Conference of American Rural Sociological  Society (1990) held in Washington D.C. In the same year, Khan joined an  international team of Congressional Lobby of eminent people from Columbia,  Zambia, Nepal and Bangladesh to plead with the Congress and the President  (Clinton) to pass the Population Bill before the US Congress. (The Bill was  passed by President Clinton, later rescinded for that year by his successor,  President Bush).Â  Â <br>
While  at Madison he also closely studied the scope and functions of information  technology in the emerging global society. So, upon return to Dhaka, in 2002, he  initiated and later in 2003 established a second private university; the <b>University of Information Technology and  Sciences: UITS. </b>That was the first private University of IT and Sciences in  the country offering Bachelor degree in subjects like <i>Electrical and Electronic Engineering</i> (EEE) or <i>Information Technology</i> even before Bangladesh University of  Engineering and Technology (BUET). However,<b> s</b>oon this venture turned into a &ldquo;business&rdquo; operation and Khan resigned from  the post of Vice Chancellor and left UITS before taking the first batch of  students through graduation! <br><br>
Meantime,  he was invited by the Ministry of Education to participate in a study to help-produce  a <b>Strategic Plan for Higher Education in  Bangladesh: 2006-2026</b> â€“a study participated by some 40 scholars and  specialists and a selected number of corporate representatives. Khan, together  with a team of experts outlined the <i>vision</i>, <i>size</i> and <i>shape</i> of that 20 Years&rsquo; Plan! This initiative has since resulted in  the creation of an <b>Academic Innovation  Fund</b> (AIF) of a billion dollar grant from the World Bank (first time on its  agenda) to support projects to ensure quality higher education in the country.  The AIF operates under the guidance of the University Grants Commission (UGC).<br>
Related  to educational entrepreneurship, Khan has received numerous academic and civil  awards including an honorary doctorate: <i>'Doctor of Humane Letters' </i>from  Hamline University, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA also, <i>Phi Beta Kappa â€“ </i>the highest academic  distinction for promoting liberal education; and a decoration: <i>Officier dan </i><i>ordre des Palmes Academiques, </i>by the Government of the  Republic of France. Most recently he has been elected a member of the Advisory  Council of AUAP (Association of Universities of Asia and Pacific - ASEAN). <br>
Khan  has authored more than 100 professional articles, monographs and book  chapters; and some years back edited a compendium of biographical work: <b>Twenty Great Bengalis</b> (UPL,  Dhaka) of a millennium from Atish Dipankar ( a Budhist Scholar) to Nobel  Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus (for Peace, 2006). Currently, he is engaged  in co-editing an enlarged second edition of <b>National Culture and Heritage - a </b>collection of essays by  distinguished authors and scholars of the country. Â <br>
All  his life Khan has been actively involved in different socio-cultural  activities. He has been a President of Lions International also a Rotary Club  (Buriganga, Dhaka), member of the Royal Golf Club, Colombo, the Jordan  Archeological Society, and many more learned bodies and professional  organizations, He is a life member of Asiatic Society of Bangladesh, life  member Bangladesh <i>Itihas Parisad,</i> and  Family Planning Association of Bangladesh. For nearly a decade, Khan had been a <b>Director of Chittagong Stock Exchange</b> and President of Bangladesh Centre for Communication Program â€“ a development  communication research organization â€“ a successor to Johns Hopkins University  (Bultimore, Maryland, USA) Communication Research Division field unit in Bangladesh.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </p>
             <p>&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Since  2009 Khan has since been working with a group of like-minded scholars,  scientists and social leaders to initiate a movement for a  fast-track and holistic economic development of agro-based economy through research in  biotechnology and synthetic biology. This initiative (since registered as  non-political, not-for-profit, membership-based voluntary organization) is now  named as <b>Committee of Action for  Research, Extension and Services â€“ CARES, </b>of which Dr. Khan is the current <b>Executive Chairman</b></p>
             <p>&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Dr.  A. Majeed Khan is the <b>President <i>Emeritus</i></b>of <b>Independent University,  Bangladesh (IUB),</b> a member of the Board of Trustee of <b>Chittagong Independent University (CIU)</b>; and a founding member of  the Education, Science, Technology, and Cultural Development Trust (<b>ESTCDT</b>).</p>
